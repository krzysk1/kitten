The Dart Kitten was designed by A.R. Weyl in 1936 and built by Dart Aircraft Ltd at Dunstable, Bedfordshire. It is an ultra-light single-seat low-wing aircraft with a fixed tailskid undercarriage. The four examples built were powered by a variety of engines of between 27 h.p. and 40 h.p.

The Dart Kitten II G-AEXT received its authorisation to fly on 30 April 1937 and had a series of owners before being badly damaged in a crash at Willingale, Essex in November 1964. It was subsequently rebuilt and in 2009 was airworthy with a private owner near Aylesbury Buckinghamshire. As of 2012 it is based with the Real Aeroplane Company at Breighton near Selby in North Yorkshire.

Notes:
This is a fantastic VFR platform which will enable enjoyable sightseeing (low and slow, at its finest), and the visual model is really nice to look at.  This is 100% vintage; tailskid, no brakes, and the radio is pretty basic; at the very least it should help you obtain the latest weather data for flight planning purposes.  If there is interest I will look to add a transponder to make it easier for online flying. To start the engine, turn on the fuel, click each of the the mags, and then touch the prop to start.  

There is a tiny battery in the model to support the handheld radio, but otherwise this aircraft has no electrical system, and engine startup is plug-in controlled (technically as long as the generator is running, the radio will work indefinitely, which is unrealistic.  This will be addressed in a future update).

This is an ultralight, and with those huge wings you need to manage your speed accordingly on flare and touchdown.  Paved runways are doable but require A LOT of concentration on touchdown, I would recommend sticking to grass and dirt for obvious reasons.  Power off stall is a really low 38 mph, and even lower with the engine running, so there is a lot of control at lower speeds.

This is my first release with fmod sound so there are bound to be some bugs, please indicate in the comments if you come across any. I plan on enhancing the sound effects as I develop a better workflow and understand the system more.

Thanks to Craig Richardson for providing the fantastic FSX model, which was really well detailed and made this build a lot simpler to complete, and Paul Clawson for the engine sounds.
